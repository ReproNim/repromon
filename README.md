# repromon

ReproNim/repromon monitoring project. The goal is to provide a core software solution to be deployed 
at Dartmouth Brain Imaging Center (DBIC) as a pilot location, to provide “online” feedback about 
ongoing data entry and acquisition (videos, MRI) as is planned to be captured and provided by the 
ReproNim projects such as ReproIn, ReproStim, ReproEvents and con/noisseur which have being developed 
separately.
